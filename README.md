# Taipei-Youbike-API-Project
YouBike, or Taipei Bike Sharing System, is a public bicycle sharing service offered by the Taipei City Department of Transportation 
With this project I collect data from the Youbike API and am looking to use this data to help users lives easier.
I am looking to implement machine learning algorithims so users can make data-driven decisions on what Youbike station to go to or the percentage chance a bike will still be available
